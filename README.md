## Favorite Book

My Favorite Book is Dale Carnegie "How to Win Friends & Influence People".

The principles of which I use in my life:
1. Become genuinely interested in other people. 
2. Smile.
3. Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.
4. Be a good listener.
5. Talk in terms of the other person's interests.
6. Make the other person feel important - and do it sincerely.

And I also formed the work of Group Lead via knowledge transfer to Successful Delivery.
